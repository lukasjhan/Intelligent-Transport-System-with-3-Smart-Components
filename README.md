# Intelligent Transport System with 3 Smart Components: Road, Traffic Light and Car (WITHUS 2019)

## ABSTRACT

The era of self-driving cars is approaching. Go further than that, We will face the fully automatic transportation system which every component of it communicate each other. The car drives itself without any human Interference and along the optimal route.

## IDEA

### Introduction

The reason why we’re using the term ‘algorithm’, not policy, is the intelligent traffic system is probably run by a high functional computer rather than human.
We describe the algorithm how intelligent transport system operates in following circumstances.

* Fully automated driving which human control no longer needed.
* Fully connected traffic components, e.g. road, traffic light and car.
* Traffic components communicate and update their information in real time.
* Electronic road can shift centerline forward and backward.
* The system knows conditions of traffic components in detail.

### The goals of the algorithm.

* Reducing average time to destination.
* Managing load on the road.
* Operating traffic components efficiently.
* Dealing with emergency effectively.

### The three traffic components

* Car (fully automated).
* Road (with electronic variable lane)
* Traffic light

## NOTE

This idea is based on the network of computer science. Road has its congestion just like network. traffic lights are similar to routers. And cars are like packets. So basically this system is a giant, complicate but slow network.

## IN PROGRESS

We are working on simulating of our algorithm.
